# Train signals

This is a repository, consisting of a program to control LED's acting as danish railroad signals using an arduino, and a python program controlling the signals over a USB connection.
By time the python program can be used to set up signals and control tramways.

For reference of differnet types of signals that this project implements, see these ressources:
